In the fall we also have a pumpkin patch and corn maze locate
at the Somers Road location. We also grow a variety of other
fruits and vegetables as well as seasonal items which may be
purchased at one of our farm markets.

The weather plays a huge role in all that we do, so it is
advised to give the farm line a call before you come to get up
to date information.
