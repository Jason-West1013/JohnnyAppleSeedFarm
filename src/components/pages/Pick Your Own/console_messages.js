        All of our u-pick locations offer a great view and fun for the whole family. We offer free tractor rides to the picking on the weekends in the fall and all containers are provided.\n
        The orchards are handicap accessible.\n
        On Mondays and Tuesday, we offer a 10% discount to seniors at our u-pick locations.\n 
        Because we have several picking locations and because crop ripening depends heavily on weather conditions, we strongly advise you call us for picking conditions, times, and locations.\n

        We usually pick at only one location at a time, so it's best to call before you come. Our apple trees are all dwarfs, which means no ladders or climbing, all fruit is easy to reach from the ground. Once the apple orchard opens for season, we are usually open everyday unless the weather is bad.

    peachMessage: `
        Peaches sometimes require extra time to ripen between pickings, therefore we do not always have u-pick peaches on a daily basis. All of our peaches are good for eating fresh and cooking with, although for canning and freezing we suggest you wait for the freestone varieties. These usually begin in late August and go to the end of the season.\n\n
        What is a freestone peach?\n 
        A peach whose flesh pulls away easily from the "stone" or pit when ripe. When processing peaches, using a freestone makes the job much easier.

        Along with the hundreds of pumpkins available at our stands, we also offer u-pick pumpkins at our patch located in our apple orchard. There is a corn maze also available at this location.
